                    <p class="aboutMe"> Hello, my name is Matt Gilliland. I graduated from University at Albany in 2014
                        with a B.S. in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics with a minor in Business.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutMe">
                        I took advantage of uAlbany's comined B.S./M.S. program and graduated the following semester
                        with an M.S. in Computer Science. For my Master's project I developed the first official uAlbany
                        App for Andriod and iOS under the guidance of the Marketing Department, and with the help of
                        another stud`ent from the University. We utilized the phonegap framework to create native apps
                        for each respective platform using HTML, CSS, and Javascript source files.
                        I was mainly in charge of writing the source code and testing the app on the android platform.
                    </p>

                    <p class="aboutMe">After graduation, I took a freelance software development job at a company
                        started by an uAlbany alumni called Northfork Web. I worked on three different projects over the
                        course of a year and filled many different roles including: research and development, project
                        manager, and lead web app developer. When Northfork Web was no longer able to provide me work, I
                        decided to get into the field of carpentry and construction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutMe"> For the following two years, I honed my skills as a craftsman working for a
                        local General Contractor. I built a name for myself as someone who was meticulous, thorough, and
                        eager to learn. At the end of 2017, my best friend and I decided to go into business for
                        ourselves and created our own company: Cherry Hill Construction, LLC. Over the past two years
                        Cherry Hill Construction has served the Hudson Valley specializing in residential new home
                        construction and renovation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutMe"> After 5 years of working in a trade, I decided that I wanted to get back into
                        the field of Computer Science. I am currently enrolled in the Fullstack Web Development bootcamp
                        at Columbia University. It is my intention to brush up on, and learn, the skills necesarry to
                        launch myself into a new career as a web developer in the NYC area.
